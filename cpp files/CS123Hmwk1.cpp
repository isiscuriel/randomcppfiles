	Question 1: A metric ton is 35,273.92 ounces. Write a program that will read 
	the weight of a package of breakfast cereal in ounces and output the weight in 
	metric tons as wells as the number of boxes yield 1 metric ton of cereal. Your 
	program should allow the user to repeat this calculation as often as the user 
	wishes.
	Question 9: Write a program that reads in ten whole numbers and that outputs 
	the sum of all the  numbers greater than 0, the sum of all the numbers less than
	zero (which will be a negative number or zero), and the sum of all the numbers 
	whether positive, negative, or zero. The user enters the ten numbers just once 
	each and the user can enter them in any order. Your program should not ask the
	user to enter the + or - #s seperately. 

	Question 14: Write a program that calculates the total grade for N classroom exe-
	rcises as a percentage. The user should input the value for N followed by each of
	the N scores and totals. Calculate the overall percentage (sum of the total points 
	earned divided by the total points possible) and output it as a percentage. Sample 
	input and output as shown below.

	How many excercises to input ? 3 

	Score recieved for excercise 1: 10 
	Total points posible for excercise 1: 10

	Score recieved for excercise 2: 7
	Total points posible for excercise 2: 12

	Score recieved for excercise 3: 5
	Total points posible for excercise 3: 8

	Your total is 22 out of 30, or 73.33%.
